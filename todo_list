1.Pulumi ---->> S3+ CloudFront.
  1.1.Instasl Pulumi and dependencies
  1.2.Credentials for AWS CLI (user with permission)
  1.3.__main__.py
    1.3.1 Create S3 as a static web.
    1.3.2 Create S3 for logs for CloudFront
    1.3.2 Create CloudFront 
   #Have trouble with access to log bucket... 
   #Tried to figure out how to troubleshoot (policies, user etc)
   #I made  infrastructure by hand. If at the end of time will be the same error, then the website will be hosted on this infrastructure((( (i hope not)
   # the same error
   
2. Web + Contentful CMS  
# install contentfull cli
  2.1 Obtain Creds for Contentfull
  #Personal Access Token +
  #Delivery token , space Id
  #clone from repo. and dependencies
  2.2 Manag. T, Deliver. T, ID ->> .env
  2.3 npm run setup 
  #See some content on Contentful. Try to find out how to work with it )))
  2.4 gatsby develop  #localhost:8000 everything works , Preview
  2.5 gatsby build #Build of website
  2.6 Added content to check Contentful - OK!

3.Set up CI/CD
  3.1 make a workflow with Build and Deploy to S3 bucket
  #my mistake was that I pushed the finished build. so I configured the web again.
  #I represent it like this:
1) Dev: git pull from a remote repository
2) Connect to CMS using credentials.
3) Dev configures the site in Contentful
4) git add . -> git commit -> git push
5) Git Actions triggered---> build ---> deploy to S3 using credentials

  3.2 СI - completed 
  3.3 First of all i need to create User , and reciev creds. -done
  #Finally !!!! I made a build. СI - finished. Just a little bit left )) 
  3.4 Add code to workflow - done
  3.5 Deploy to S3 done!!!
  
  #Error : This step has been truncated due to its large size
  #if i make .zip file it will be good for delivery
  #but as I know it is impossible to unzip the bucket in s3
  #at the moment I can`t find a solution for this problem
  #I saw that people have the same problem, and the use Lambda. But i never worked with it(
  
  just in case, I'll leave the domain for CF -https://d18vkc1hzzhnvl.cloudfront.net/
  The assignment was interesting, but I failed.
  I learned what GH Actions and CMS are)))
